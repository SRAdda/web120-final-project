  <p>Nello’s experience spans more than three decades, including work with trendsetting talents in London, Milan, Barcelona, Los Angeles, Seattle and Vancouver. His passion for hair design and perfecting personal style began at the age of 12, when he chose to apprentice as a “barbiere.”</p>
  <p>Upon mastery of classic Italian barbering and completion of school, Nello headed for London to train and work with the then up-and-coming, now legendary, team of Toni and Guy Mascolo, founders of TONI &amp; GUY.</p>
  <p>After more than decade at the forefront of his field in Europe, career opportunities beckoned Nello to the U.S. In Los Angeles, he continued his editorial and commercial work styling models, actors, and celebrities. In the 90s a series of advertising assignments brought Nello to Seattle, and he fell in love with the city which reminded him so much of Italy.</p>
